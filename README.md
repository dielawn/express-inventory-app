P (Passenger): Standard passenger vehicle tires.
LT (Light Truck): Designed for vehicles that carry heavy loads or perform light towing tasks.
C (Commercial): Tires for commercial vehicles that carry heavier loads than typical passenger vehicles.
D (Heavy Duty): Often associated with tires designed for heavier than standard loads, not as common in categorization as LT.
ST (Special Trailer): Tires specifically designed for trailers, including boat trailers, utility trailers, and other types of towable equipment.
Additional Tire Classifications to Consider
T (Temporary Spare): Also known as "donut" spares, these are temporary tires intended to get you to a garage or a safe spot to change your tire.
AT (All Terrain): Designed to provide balanced performance in on-road and off-road conditions.
MT (Mud Terrain): Specifically designed for off-road environments with large tread blocks for mud traction.
HT (Highway Terrain): Optimized for sealed road driving with features that enhance ride comfort and fuel efficiency.
UHP (Ultra High Performance): Tires designed for sports performance in terms of speed and handling.
RFT (Run Flat Tire): These tires can continue to be driven on temporarily even after they lose air pressure.
Additional Considerations
EV (Electric Vehicle): Some manufacturers are now developing tires specifically designed for electric vehicles, which are generally heavier than traditional vehicles due to the weight of the battery packs. These tires often emphasize low rolling resistance to maximize battery range.
